# Hi there, I'm Amodh! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a final year university student studying Data Science, with a passion for Finance and Data Analysis. I have a strong technical background in machine learning techniques and a love for problem-solving. I enjoy working in diverse teams to create actionable insights using Machine Learning tools and data visualization software.<br>

## Projects

- ðŸ¤– [Sentiment Calculator](https://github.com/yourname/sentiment-calculator): A machine learning model that uses AdaBoost and logistic regression models to determine if Amazon product reviews are positive or negative.
- ðŸ’° [PnL Program](https://github.com/yourname/pnl-program): A program that uses previous Bitcoin values and linear regression to identify an optimal trading strategy and display the potential returns of the best subset of categories to select.
- ðŸ“ˆ [Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/yourname/handwritten-digit-recognition):A project that uses PCA analysis and K-means clustering to recognize handwritten digits using the sklearn digits dataset. This project also compares the efficiency of different machine learning models, such as decision trees and logistic regression.
- ðŸ“Š [Winter Clothing Sales](https://github.com/amathuraa/Data_analysis/tree/main/HKTV_MALL_ANALYSIS): A project that uses HKTV Mall data and Hong Kong Observatory temperature data to identify trends in sales and generate revenue-driving insights for clients.
- ðŸ“‰ [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/amathuraa/Data_analysis/tree/main/Car_price_modelling): A project that uses linear regression, one-hot encoders, and greedy algorithms to predict the price of a used car.

## Fun Fact

Did you know that I once used machine learning to predict the gender of a person using their facial measurements? I trained a decision tree model using data on eyebrow length, eyelash length, forehead size, and nose protrusion to classify the face as masculine or feminine. And guess what? My model was accurate for 23 out of the 24 friends I tested it on (sorry, Eva :D)
